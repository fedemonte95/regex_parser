# regex_parser
This proyect is a compiler for regular expresions. The program receives two inputs, the regular expresion and the file where the program most find the matches of the inserted regular expresion. Internaly the program parsers the regex into a deterministic finite automata and use that DFA for the reconossance. 
The output is a list with all the matches that are in the input file.
